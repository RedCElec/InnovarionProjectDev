There is few thing to do BEFORE compiling (ONLY UNDER LINUX)

1->first in the mma8451_pi repository you should run the command
    make install

    It will install the dependencies on the system at /usr/..

2->Then in the src Repo you could run the command  
    make

    It will compile the main.cpp normaly everything right

3->Finally run 
    ./tester_NotBuild
